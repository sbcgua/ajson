# Features

- Parse JSON content into a flexible form, not fixed to any predefined data structure, allowing to modify the parsed data, selectively access its parts and slice subsections of it.
- Allows conversion to fixed ABAP structures/tables (`to_abap`) - strict or "corresponding".
- Supports timestamps
- Supports reference instantiation
- Supports checking node types
- Convenient interface to manipulate the data:
  - `set( value )`
  - `set( structure )` + control over item order (sorted or historical)
  - `set( table )`
  - `push` to an array item-per-item
  - `set( another_instance_of_ajson )`
  - also typed e.g. `set_date`, `set_number`
  - also `setx` for text-based value setting e.g. `setx( '/a/b:123' )` (useful e.g. for constants in APIs or in unit-tests)
  - node deletion
- Seralization to string (indented and not).
- Freezing (read only) instance content.
- Filtering - create a JSON skipping empty values, predefined paths, or your custom filter.
- Mapping - rule-based changing node names (e.g. snake case to camel case, upper/lower case)
- Iterating (conveniently) through the array items or object members
- Utility to calculate difference between 2 JSONs
- See **[documentation](./docs/intro)** for more details ...
